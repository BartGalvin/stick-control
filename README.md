# Stick Control

Stick Control is a browser-based tool to practice snare drum rudiments.

Users can cycle through a single rudiment from 1 to 40 times each, at tempos between 20 and 160 BPM. The current note is highlighted on the staff.

A metronome is included, and users can specify the frequency of metronome clicks per measure.

# Technologies

Stick Control was developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and relies on the
[VexFlow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) JavaScript library for rendering
music notation, as well as Chris Wilson's [Web Audio
Metronome](https://github.com/cwilso/metronome).
